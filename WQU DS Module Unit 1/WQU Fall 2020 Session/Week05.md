To make the most of your learning journey, efficient time management is key. You do not have to wait for these weekly emails to access content - it can all be found in your JupyterHub environment.

WQU Fall 2020 Session 
Unit 1: Scientific Computing and Python for Data Science

Week 5

 
Did you know that one of our students recently won a Data Science competition on DrivenData.org? It’s true! He started in Unit I (just like you) and entered the competition while completing Unit II. Think about everything you’ve learned over the last few weeks, and imagine everything else you’ll know when you finish this module and then Unit II. You can do it!

 
Remember that all assignments must be completed by December 4th, 2020 to receive a certificate of completion.
