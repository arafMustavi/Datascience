Week 2

 
You’ve made it to Week 2. Good work! If you haven’t had a chance to watch the videos and read the notebooks from last week, don’t worry. This is a good week to catch up. This is also a good week to come to office hours with Don. Students are asking a lot of great questions there!

 
Remember that all assignments must be completed by December 4th, 2020 to receive a certificate of completion.
