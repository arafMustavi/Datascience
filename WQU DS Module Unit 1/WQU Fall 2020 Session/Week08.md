Dear Student,

On behalf of the entire WorldQuant University team, congratulations on successfully completing Unit I of our Applied Data Science Module and on your dedication, hard work, and active participation over the past eight weeks. We hope that your newly-gained data science skills will empower you in whatever industry you work.

Next Steps

In exchange for the opportunity of taking the Module for free, we ask that you complete this anonymous End-of-course Survey.

We rely on your feedback to improve the curriculum, its delivery, and the student experience overall. To get your final perspective on the program, please complete this end-of-course survey. We appreciate your avid participation and your readiness to offer your perspective. 

Continue Learning with Unit II of our Module

Our goal is to offer our Applied Data Science Module  to as many qualified candidates around the world as possible. If you are interested in developing your statistical analysis and machine learning skills in Unit II and/or you know of, or are part of, a community of interest whose members you think would benefit from our programs, please let us know. 

We wish you the best of luck with your endeavors. 

Keep in touch,
