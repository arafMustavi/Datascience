Dear students, 

We are reaching out with your weekly brief for week #1. 

While the final due date for all assignments is 12/04/2020, we strongly recommend that you complete each assignment in its respective week. Remember, you must complete all assignments to receive a certificate of completion. 

To make the most of your learning journey, efficient time management is key. You do not have to wait for these weekly emails to access content - it can all be found in your JupyterHub environment. 

If you have any content-related questions, be sure to take full advantage of the learning community made available to you. We encourage you to engage with your peers and instructors on the discussion board. 

Best,
WQU DS Module Team

Announcements/Notes: 
The first question many students have is: “Where can I ask questions?” The answer depends on the type question.

Before you raise any questions, watch our introductory video. Many of your questions will be answered in the video.

Look to see if your question has been answered on our FAQ page. 

If you have questions about course content, post them on the discussion board or discuss them with Don during office hours. 

If you have questions about admissions or technical issues, contact dsmodule@wqu.org.
