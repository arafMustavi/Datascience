Dear students, 

We are reaching out with your weekly brief for week #3. 

While the final due date for all assignments is 12/4/2020, we strongly recommend that you complete each assignment in its respective week. Remember, you must complete all assignments to receive a certificate of completion. 

To make the most of your learning journey, efficient time management is key. You do not have to wait for these weekly emails to access content - it can all be found in your JupyterHub environment. 

If you have any content-related questions, be sure to take full advantage of the learning community made available to you. We encourage you to engage with your peers and instructors on the discussion board. 

Best,
WQU DS Module Team


WQU Fall 2020 Session 
Unit 1: Scientific Computing and Python for Data Science

Week 3

 
This week, we want to recognize the tremendous work everyone is doing. We’ve heard from many of you about how you’re managing to take the course even though you’re also working or studying full-time, or taking care of family. Learning something new is never easy, and we’re so impressed with your progress. 

 
Remember that all assignments must be completed by December 4th, 2020 to receive a certificate of completion.

Announcements/Notes: 

If you receive a grader score of 0.9999999999999999, it still means you have the exact correct answer. The difference is due to round-off error from the grader. Don’t waste your time trying to get it to display 1.0. Keep moving!

Connectivity: If you have an issue connecting to your JupyterHub, the best thing to do is wait 15 minutes and try again. If you continue to have issues, please email us as dsmodule@wqu.org .
